This 2D world is comprised of an ocean with various features and vehicles.  Near the bottom of the screen there is a series of docks within a protected harbor, which includes a narrowish channel leading out to the ocean proper, which is dotted with sea rocks and patches of fog.

In this world, there are three different actors/vehicles.  The first and most complex is the cargo vessel.  These spawn near the edges of the screen and attempt to seek their way around rocks to the channel opening.  Once they reach the opening, they switch to a crowd path following steering method to navigate through the channel.  They will make vague attempts to follow right of way through the channel and avoid other cargo boats, though the symbol representing cargo boats is much larger than when this was first implemented so they will generally partially pass through some obstacles.  Once in the harbor, the cargo boat will claim a dock to itself and arrive there.  Once they've arrived at the dock, they load up with cargo and are given a destination somewhere along the top half of the stage at the edge.  They seek back to the channel, path through it, and then seek their destination.  If they reach it, they return from a random area of the screen 15 seconds later, having presumably dropped off the cargo at the destination and receiving payment.

The second actor is the pirate vessel.  These rascals avoid the harbor and the channel, preferring to wander the shallow seas in search of slow, vulnerable cargo ships to prey on.  If one enters their line of sight, a chase will ensue, with cargo boats attempting to seek safety while evading the pursuing pirate. (sometimes, the steering force from seeking safety [either a patch of fog, the harbor entrance, or the cargo destination if they have one.  Whichever is closest.] directly contradicts the steering force from fleeing, causing the cargo ship to simply slow down and await death.  Pirates also have this problem when chased by the navy.  The problem is most obvious when the pursuing vessel is between the fleeing vessel and its safety goal.).

The third vessel is the navy PT boat.  These guys wander the shallow seas near the harbor looking for criminal scum.  They will chase any pirate they see.  They will also deign to escort cargo ships to the harbor, if the price is right.  Cargo ships who successfully bring a load of cargo to the edge of the screen will always attempt to hire a navy boat on return.  The PT boat will follow the cargo ship around until it reaches the harbor.  If it sees a pirate vessel while escorting, it will attempt a chase, leaving the cargo ship vulnerable to other pirates until the navy boat has given up chase or sunk the pirate.

In the sea there floats several patches of fog, represented by large, transparent, slowly wandering circles.  Cargo ships can seek refuge from pirates here, and pirates can seek refuge from the law.  When a boat enters fog, it becomes invisible to all other boats.  This will cause pirates to either switch targets or wander aimlessly through the fog, and navy boats will do the same if a pirate enters the fog.  However, unlucky cargo boats and pirates can still come across enemies in the fog by accident, and the result will be the same as if there was no fog.

The large and awkward size of the boats, especially cargo boats, means that they can often get hung up on sea rocks.  Their shape also causes rapidly fluctuating turns to look pretty ugly, compared to a circle or a square or really anything not bullet shaped.
